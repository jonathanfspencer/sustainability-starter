## Steps to Launching a Municipal Sustainability Commission
 1. Determine whether your municipality has a commission already.
 2. Find some neighbors who share your interests and invite them to join you.
 3. Contact your elected officials to let them know what you are doing and why it is important.
 4. Write a resolution establishing your commission and present it at a city council meeting.

## Now What?
* Follow the process in your resolution to nominate members to your commission.
* Establish a regular meeting schedule.
* Seek input from the community to determine goals and objectives.
* Use the ICLEI Toolkit to create a Sustainability Plan.
* Assign ownership of goals and objectives to commission members to see them through to completion.
* Publish your accomplishments and seek feedback from the community to set new goals.

## What Else Can We Do?
* Provide your community with a list of local sustainability resources (recycling information, landscaping grants, solar bulk buy opportunities, etc.).
* Engage your local library to offer talks on sustainability issues.
* Meet with your local schools to add sustainability to their curricula.
* Talk to your recycling provider to see how to increase participation and compliance.
* Challenge local restaurants to reduce their use of single-serving containers and utensils.
* Establish and Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policy for your municipality.
